This repository contains the Cloud Workshop Reporting Laravel and PHP code changes that should have supported Google App Engine on the Standard Platform. This repository contains all the changes to the code, configuration, and Laravel 5.4.x to 5.7.x upgrade. Despite following Google Documentation this code still does not work on Google Cloud. This repository is kept around to capture the changes made to app.yaml and composer.json as well as the updated Laravel code recommended by Google. This repository is for backup and reference only until Google fixes their problems required to support Laravel on their Standard PHP Platform.
